Conva replaces your current comment system with a combination of polling and conversation

== Description ==

Conva is an online commenting platform designed to enhance the interaction between site owners and users. Our unique “poll and discuss method” allows a site visitor to vote on a given topic and follow up with a response in 280 characters or less. This encourages commenters to provide well thought-out explanations from their own perspective. Other users can vote on a given comment, generating buzz on the site and encouraging returns to view trending comments. The better the response – the better the score. Everyday readers benefit from the convenience of viewing the best responses possible, and site owners can take advantage of the numerous opportunities from the information gathered. Information that can be used as a basis for advertising, site traffic monitoring and content feedback. 

A more engaged community. More traffic. Better page ranking. Audience insight. By better serving users, Conva can better serve sites. Think of it as a new wave comment section.
