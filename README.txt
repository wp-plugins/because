Because replaces your current comment system with a combination of polling and conversation

== Description ==

Many websites contain comment sections to encourage user interaction and feedback. Unfortunately, those sections are often riddled with tiring explanations, narrow-minded views and potentially toxic remarks.

At Because we see this as an opportunity for change. With our “poll and discuss” method, users are able to submit their own ideas, thoughts and feelings within a given character limit. This encourages clear and concise responses to every post.  In addition, users benefit from a platform that welcomes many perspectives, giving users a voice in commenting they've never had before.

But we’re not stopping there. We recognize the potential for content managers to use information provided by a more engaged user base  for advertising, site traffic monitoring and content feedback. By better serving users, Because can better serve sites.

We’re giving users a voice. And websites a choice.
